A computer vision-based system for real-time drowning detection using deep learning and object detection algorithms. This system can analyze video feeds from cameras around pools or water bodies to automatically detect potential drowning incidents and alert caregivers.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Process live video feeds or recorded videos
- **Dual Detection Methods**: 
  - CNN-based classification for single person scenarios
  - Proximity-based detection for multiple people scenarios
- **Configurable Alerts**: Voice alerts and visual notifications
- **Statistics Tracking**: Monitor detection performance and statistics
- **Easy Configuration**: Centralized configuration system
- **Developer Friendly**: Clean, modular code with comprehensive documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drowning-detection.git
cd drowning-detection
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Basic Usage
```bash
python DrownDetect.py --source video_filename.mp4
```

#### Using Webcam
```bash
python DrownDetect.py --source 0
```

#### Advanced Options
```bash
python DrownDetect.py --source video.mp4 --confidence 0.6 --no-voice
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--source` | Video file name or camera index | Required |
| `--confidence` | Object detection confidence threshold | 0.5 |
| `--no-voice` | Disable voice alerts | False |

## 🧠 How It Works

### Detection Methods

1. **Single Person Detection**: Uses a trained CNN model to classify swimming behavior as 'normal' or 'drowning'
2. **Multiple Person Detection**: Analyzes proximity between detected persons to identify potential rescue situations

### Model Architecture

The system uses a custom CNN with the following architecture:
- 4 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling
- Global average pooling for handling variable input sizes
- 2 Fully connected layers with dropout for regularization
- Softmax output for binary classification

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `src/config.py` to customize:

```python
class DetectionConfig:
    IMAGE_SIZE = 224                    # Input image size for CNN
    MIN_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD = 50         # Distance threshold for multiple person detection
    DETECTION_CONFIDENCE = 0.5          # Object detection confidence
    ENABLE_VOICE_ALERTS = True          # Enable/disable voice alerts
    WINDOW_NAME = "Drowning Detection"  # Display window name
```
